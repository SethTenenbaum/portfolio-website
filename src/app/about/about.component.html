        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">I'm also a certified Advanced Biostructural Correction practitioner for about 10 years and have recently developed methods to apply that to align the scutes of turtle shells. I have two 35-year-old turtles that receive the treatment and are thriving well.  They love avocados and mangos too.  Look at how straight and symmetrical DaVinci's spine is. Since correcting his alignment, the pitting on his shell stopped progressing.</p>
